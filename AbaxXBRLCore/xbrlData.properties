# Processing Engine can be configured to have multiple modes. 
# The supported modes are [server, desktop, viewer]. Certain environments require
# Processing Engine to run in a particular mode for optimization. A server application 
# should configure the mode as server to minimize memory footprint for large
# documents. Certain features may not be available in all modes. For example, editing
# linkbases is not available in server mode. See user documentation for other details.
MODE=desktop

# Processing Engine can be configured to use different processing models, depending on 
# the use case.
# 
# The supported processing models are [full]. Certain environments require
# Processing Engine to run with a particular processing model for optimization of throughput. For example, a server  
# application should configure Processing Engine to run with an incremental processing model to minimize memory footprint 
# for large documents. Certain features may not be available in all processing models. For example, editing
# of linkbases or formula processing is not immediately available using a future incremental processing model.
#
# Please see user documentation for further discussion on the modes of Processing Engine.
